# Static Comp

This project was to take a static composition of a website and recreate it using HTML and CSS. We were allowed to add our own personality and touches to it, but we had to keep our format very much the same.

The comp:

# Design Choice & Features

Superheroes are awesome, and Marvel comics have some really cool alternate universe that are cool to explore.  Marvel heroes typically exist in all different universes, but have some interesting twists and stories. One of the most expansive is Spider-man, so I wanted to share how unique and fun his alternate spider-men can be. Spider-man's colors are the reason behind the background, header, and hover colors. The information on the cards is correct, if one was curious to learn more about the individual Spider-men and women, the links will open to an informative video on thh corresponding hero.

# Code Style

I tried to set a standard naming convention and follow it, as I want to be precise in my naming.
